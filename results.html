        <b><h1>WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH? </h1></b>
        <p>
            To conclude, as what we can see from our data for clothing pieces, 
            sweaters were sold the least compared to the other clothing pieces. 
            And on the other hand, jeans are the most popular and are sold most 
            in the market. Then for the brands, as what we can see from the 
            data above, we can conclude that Gucci sells the least amount in 
            the market while on the other hand, Nikes were sold most in the market. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Jeans sell more than sweaters since jeans are worn more and are casually 
            used especially during peoples days out, work days or even school days. 
            Sweaters on the other hand sell the least since sweaters just keeps 
            people warm during the cold and not everyday especially during the hot 
            and sunny days. For the branding, Nike sells most and on the other hand, 
            Gucci sells least. Nike sells most since this brand sells all sporting 
            gear from all kinds of shoes, all kinds of athletes apparel, from 
            sporting all types of sporting equipment and more. Gucci on the other 
            hand is a luxury brand which means that they are used and are purchased by 
            people sometimes. 

        </p>
        <p>  
            If the data from the clothing types were used as a reference by the leading 
            brand with the most rating, Nike, their branding value would increase due to 
            a probable increase in their income if they would produce more jeans. If the 
            brand Gucci would refer their production of their products to the data results 
            of the types of clothing, they could be properly guided on which items to focus 
            in order for them to at least have better ratings in the market.

        </p>
        <p>
            For future research, we would suggest that you add more variables to the data set. 
            This includes a wider variety of brands and clothing items to give you more profit 
            on your work and also which you should create more. The rating system can also be 
            changed to a scale of whole numbers 1-10 to make the analysis easier and also give 
            more accurate results.
